Project: Viking Store Admin
========================
a Project by [Graham Turner](https://github.com/tgturner) and [Hannah Squire](https://github.com/hannahsquier).

The Viking Store Admin project was an exercise in SQL queries without the benefit of Rails Associations. This pushed creators to fully understand who ActiveRecord queries the database rather than chocking it up to the 'magic' of Ruby on Rails.
